NoIntervention is the simulation of the control group where no prevention program is carried out.
DPP-* is the simulation of the below prevention programs:

  DPP-RG refers to the study by Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group, “Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle
intervention or metformin,” The New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 346, no. 6, p. 393, 2002.
